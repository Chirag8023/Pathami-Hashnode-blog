> **Q. What is Hacktoberfest ?
**<br>**-> Hacktoberfest is Digitalocean’s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to Open Source projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.**

# How Hacktoberfest helps us in our Open Source journey ? 🤔
Hacktoberfest is a very popular event as everyone knows that it create a environment of excitement for everyone.
People participating in hacktoberfest increasing every year  as it's becoming popular every year, but before taking part in any event or activity first we should question ourselves to know some things that <br>"**what this is all about ?"**,<br>"**Is it right for me ?**",<br>"**how we get benefit from it ?**" or<br>"**is it really helpful or just a marketing strategy ?**"

**<center>Here are some questions that helps you to understand the real meaning of hacktoberfest<br>👇👇</center>**
## What this excitement is all about ? 🤩
Hacktoberfest first organized in 2014 because the community team at DigitalOcean wanted to create a program to inspire open source contributions. That first year, in 2014, the first Hacktoberfest participants were asked for 50 commits, and those who completed the challenge received a reward of swag. 676 people signed up and 505 forged ahead to the finish line, earning stickers and a custom limited-edition T-shirt.<br>

Since then it become an entry point for developers contributing to open source projects, much more than a program, it’s clear that Hacktoberfest has become a global community movement with a shared set of values and passion for giving back. It’s a pleasure to watching it grow every year.


## What  Hacktoberfest really teaches us ? 👩🏻‍🏫
First let's see what Digitalocean says about Hacktoberfest:
> **Why did we create Hacktoberfest? And why does DigitalOcean invest so much into the event? The truth may surprise you. We believe in using our resources to broaden awareness of open source projects and in reinvesting in our communities. As customers and creators of open source software, this is just one of the ways we reinvest in the people and technology we believe in.** 

Hacktoebrfest divided into two main roles: **Maintainers **and **Contributors**

Usually people who already have knowledge about open source participate as Maintainer and Beginners participate as Contributor, Both have their own experiences and learnings.<br>

<tr><td><center>Real-world exposure</td></tr>
<tr><td><center>Community recognition</td></tr>
<tr><td><center>Learning how to collaborate</td></tr>
<tr><td><center>Upskilling</td></tr>
<tr><td><center>A tree planted on your name or Getting a Hacktoberfest t-shirt.</td></tr>
</table>


## Is "4th PR merged" final destination ? ☠
NO !!! 😑 <br> We already read it above that it's just an entry point for beginners who wants to step into world of Open Source.<br>
See what Daniel Zaltsman (Senior Manager, Developer Relations and Programs at DigitalOcean) says about it 👇
> **The great news is that Hacktoberfest is not really a month-long celebration of open source - it’s a culture and community that is always looking to give back. Through this ongoing work, we can accomplish almost anything we set our minds to. We’re looking forward to seeing what you have and will build all year long.**


## What after Hacktoberfest ?🌐
When you started your Open Source journey, Then there are endless possibilities about what you can do and which programs you can take part next, To know more about this you can read this blog by Karuna Tata,
where she talks about [25+ Paid Open Source Programs and Internships.](https://blog.commclassroom.org/25-paid-open-source-programs-and-internships)

# What Is Final Conclusion Then ? <br>🤫🧐🤭🤯🥳🤡😱😤🤑🥱🤔
### When we talk about a **beginner **(👦🏻)
In the end Hacktoberfest is very good for a **beginner **(👦🏻) to step into world of open source & know about it and start his contribution journey, Also there are some swags that attract him to participate into hacktoberfest ‼<br>
So he should definitely take part and unlock some new experiences in his life. 🌟 

### But when we talk about an **expert **(👨🏻‍💻)
People who are **working professionals**(👨🏻‍💻) & **who already know about open source** also take part in hacktoberfest and it's really great to see that they are taking some time out so they can contribute to Open Source, But Some people wait for October month so they can contribute to open source !<br>
People who have knowledge of Open Source should not bound themselves to this specific month of October so they can do contribution. No, Open Source contribution can be done anytime so just do it. 👍😉

### And when we talk about people who do it only for T-shirt(👕)
When we talk about those people **who are not interested**(👕) in learning about anything, But still they want free T-shirt, These people really made this event hard for others. They are making problems for maintainers, even if they get a free T-shirt, Because there are only limited t-shirts available they are also keeping some Motivated Beginners from getting his reward. <br>So never do this to someone, You will get so many things elsewhere so leave some for beginners. 🙂
