Hey everyone! It's been a while since I last wrote.  
So here I'm now, join me on a journey through the exciting realms of technology that I've navigated up to the milestone of graduation. From coding escapades to community connections, this is a tale of exploration, growth, and the fascinating discoveries that peppered my academic voyage. So, grab a virtual seat, and let's embark on this flavorful exploration of the tech universe! üåêüçï

### :)Starting of the college\_

I'm a BCA (**Bachelor in Computer Application**) Student, My college started around October 2021. I already knew most of the basics about computer hardware, Operating systems, programming languages or basic tech concepts before college, yet around December I found this website called [Code.org](http://Code.org), so I revisited some basics things like :

‚Ä¢ **Scratch Programming Language**  
‚Ä¢ **Algorithmic/Logical Thinking**  
‚Ä¢ **Problem-Solving**

and here's one of the legendary hour of code certificate üìú:

I understand these certificates might not carry a huge value on their own, but sometimes it's nice to give ourselves a little pat on the back and remember that we accomplished that.

***Then*** there was a drastic shift in my life, When one day suddenly the YouTube algorithm suggested me that video of [@Kunal Khushwaha](https://twitter.com/kunalstwt) and luckily I opened it ‚ú®:

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVoq5vjNI1Y] 

After watching that I started finding all videos of Kunal Khushwaha and ended up knowing so many new concepts I never heard before :  
\- **Open Source ‚òï**  
**\- Learning in public üìö**  
**\- Remote Jobs üë®‚Äçüíª**  
**\- Tech Communities** üë•

I discovered tech opportunities on **Twitter**(currently known as X), so I began exploring and following communities and people to learn about the tech industry from various perspectives. I found valuable communities that helped me enhance my understanding of modern concepts and trends.

### \-) January 2022\_

In the starting one of the platform I discovered was [MIT Open CourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) and what is that ?

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704798633515/1a11662f-07a1-44ce-aa6c-56ada0b777d5.png align="center")](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?l=Undergraduate&t=Computer%20Science)

> MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) is a free online platform that provides access to a wide range of course materials from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It includes lecture notes, assignments, and exams, allowing anyone with internet access to learn from MIT's educational resources at their own pace.

MIT's awesome professors giving lectures on hot tech topics, why would I want to miss that ! üòâ  
My focus was into security field at that time so I attended this course : [Computer Systems Security](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/video_galleries/video-lectures/) and attended few lectures and ended up learning basics of :  
**\- Buffer Overflow / Stacks Basics**  
**\- System Vulnerabilities**  
**\- Some Assembly**

### ;) March 2022

Jump straight to the first end semester exams and still managed to catch live workshops on Web3 by [The Product House](https://twitter.com/0xTPH). Basically, I was on a mission to explore different tech fields, and Web3 caught my eye. I stumbled upon this great chance on Twitter ‚Äì The Product House was hosting live workshops covering topics like;

* **Blockchain 101: üß±üí°**
    
* **DeFi: üí∏üåê**
    
* **DAOs: ü§ùüåê**
    
* **Metaverse: üååüåê**
    
* **NFTs: üñºÔ∏èüåê**
    
* **Cryptocurrency 101: üí∞üí°**
    
* **MetaMask: ü¶äüîê**
    
* **Opportunities in Web3.0: üåêüöÄ**
    

I joined in to learn the basics of Web3, enough to grasp the latest tech trends and figure out if this was my next tech adventure or not.

%[https://twitter.com/0xTPH/status/1505200680050601984] 

Well, you can still watch all of these whenever you want! If you're interested in exploring, here's the link to 23 hours' worth of content:

üçü Additional Tip: If you're truly serious about diving into Web3, check out Alchemy University. They offer ***FREE*** professional-level bootcamps in three exciting paths:

1. **Ethereum Developer**
    
2. **JavaScript Basics**
    
3. **Solidity**
    

It's a fantastic opportunity to level up your skills! üöÄüéì

I made it in, but after diving into Web3, I realized it's not my cup of tea. That's the beauty of exploration‚Äîno need to stress, just observe and see if it's a good fit for you or not.

### ‚Ä¢)April 2022\_

Now you would've understood that I usually stumble across different posts or people on Twitter about different Events / Hackathons / Conferences, so this month I found a live workshop series by Masai School where we try to clone different webpages of established brands like Tinder, Uber, Nike and learn HTML/CSS and designing concepts on the way while building. Check it out:

### \*)June 2022\_

Well previous workshops give me enough motivation to continue my learning and get serious about it so I started **#100DaysOfCode on twitter**.

> #100daysofcode is a challenge where you code for at least an hour every day for 100 days straight. It's a cool way to build your coding skills and stay motivated by sharing your progress with others using the hashtag.

I started quoting my journey day by day, first I completed this very beginner friendly course on APIs on FreeCodeCamp by [Craig Dennis](https://github.com/craigsdennis) from [@Twilio](https://twitter.com/twilio) :

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us] 

And I shared my learning on twitter like this:

```javascript
I'm officially committing to #100DaysOfCode
!Hello World!
It's Day 001/100

‚öúToday I learn about Basics of API's:
What is API's;
Remote API's;
How web works;
Rest API;
Exploring various API's online;
Using API's from CLI;
Basic use of postman;
```

For a comprehensive journey into becoming a Fullstack developer, explore the FreeCodeCamp website. They provide a range of courses that cover everything you need. And yeah It's obviously Freee. üòå

%[https://www.freecodecamp.org/] 

‚Ä¢ Also in this month I completed my Postman student expert training and gain enough skills to understand and test APIs using Postman and Become a Postman Student Expert in the community. I already talked about it in this blog \[üçüread it, you can apply too \]:

%[https://chirag8023.hashnode.dev/my-journey-of-becoming-postman-student-expert] 

‚Ä¢ Another cool thing I did was set up my blog on Hashnode. Realizing the importance of documenting and sharing knowledge with others, especially the concept of Learning in Public, I found it easy to create my blog. I gave it a personal touch, establishing a unique brand, and it's now gaining attention from some cool folks in the tech community. Consider documenting your journey too ‚Äì it's highly beneficial and strongly recommended.

### &lt;)July 2022\_

Still the year was far from the end and I started playing this game, this something like combination of RPG and coding called "TwilioQuest" developed by Twilio.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704807626814/3afbde33-b9d2-4ffc-83cf-127485267917.png align="center")

well it had so many levels related to fields like Open Source, Javascript, Python and so on and it looked like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704808173144/90589c57-bfee-42c2-9348-43093fa27bc1.png align="center")

Well it was really great experience don't know how to explain ü§Ø, but I played and learnt about:

* Open Source
    
* Python
    
* JavaScript / Node.js / Express.js
    
* APIs
    
* Twilio services
    

then next month also they organized a bootcamp called "operator academy" and I took part in it and graduated in August 2022.

### &gt;) September 2022\_

Nothing just my PR got merged for first time. Well It is a big thing for any first timer in open source. It was a non-code contribution to a project called [Kubescape](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape). Not a very big contribution but still the Kubescape community was so generous they sent a very nice gift üéÅ and this single act of generosity firmly connected me with the open-source community, creating a bond that extends to all aspects of my tech journey.

well if you don't believe then here üò¥:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704809344304/2c6c7814-477a-4e8d-bee3-694888c1c6e8.png align="center")

‚Ä¢ Next thing about this month is [Global Hack Week](https://ghw.mlh.io/). Well this week long monthly event started by MLH community and every month there is different track like Games, Security, Cloud, Data Science, AI/ML, etc. So there were several live streams throughout the day for rest of the week featuring professionals from different background in tech, there were also nice challenges to submit throughout the week.

üçü\*\*:\*\* If you Register and Join in few of these streams and learn something, they will sent you a really nice thank you postcard with some cool stickers.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704809972473/44f509b1-00b7-4d49-8c83-f21e58cd1cb3.png align="center")

%[https://ghw.mlh.io/] 

It was the first Global Hack Week, and I hopped on board for the first time. The event covered a wide array of topics ranging from web development and cloud to machine learning, along with some non-tech fun streams. I found the experience so enriching that I made a habit of attending it every month thereafter. The diversity of subjects and the vibrant atmosphere kept me coming back for more! üåêüöÄ

### @)October 2022\_

Everyone in the tech community is familiar with the significance of October ‚Äì it's Hacktoberfest time üéÉüíª! But don't worry, I won't deep dive into it too much here. If you're interested, I've already covered it in a previous blog, and you can read about it.  
*Here*:

%[https://chirag8023.hashnode.dev/is-hacktoberfest-really-important] 

I successfully wrapped up my first Hacktoberfest by submitting and getting 4+ PRs merged. It was an enriching experience contributing to various organizations such as MindsDB, Amplication, FreeCodeCamp, TryShape, AppFlowy-IO. My contributions ranged from video creation and blogging to both non-code and code contributions. This month-long event became a profound exploration for me into the essence of Open Source.

### :))Yet Story doesn't end here:\_

Well, that was just the beginning of my tech journey. Since then, numerous of exciting events has unfolded. Let me walk you through some of the highlights :

* **Exploring Tech Conferences:** I stumbled upon various tech conferences like BackBlaze Tech Day, KubeCon, SIGNALconf. Although I might not recall each one's name, but Twitter is buzzing with these events, so you too can find out these kind of events simply by exploring twitter.
    
* **Joining Global Hack Week:** I started joining it on a monthly basis. (ended up collecting so many thank-you postcards.üòÖ)
    
* **#DevOps with Kunal Khushwaha:** Learning bootcamp where I strengthen up my ropes of Docker, Kubernetes, Git & GitHub, Linux, and YAML.
    
* **Venturing into Golang:** Embarking on a journey to master the Go programming language.
    
* **Attending IRL Web3 Event :** Still it was fun to attend an in-person tech gathering because it was my first irl Web3 event in my own city.
    
* **GitHub Student Developer Pack:** Securing my GitHub Student Developer Pack, filled with offers from various organizations, ranging from valuable learning resources to free credits, enabling exploration across different fields without spending a penny.
    
* **Ready Player 50 Challenge:** Participating in the Ready Player 50 challenge by CS50, a test involving prompt injection to extract sensitive data from an AI chatbot. It was tough but immensely rewarding, embodying a "learn through challenge" spirit. üöÄüéÆ
    

Well it's the story until now.
